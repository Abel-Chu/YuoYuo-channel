| **Front-end** |

### Architecture
1. `JavaScript` is tasked with packaging data from the front-end and transmitting it to the back-end. This process leverages technologies such as AJAX for asynchronous data exchange, enabling the front-end interface to immediately reflect any changes in back-end data.

2. `Java` is primarily employed for scripting Controllers (which manage the data flow from the front-end to the back-end) and Helpers (which assist in the data transmission from the back-end to the front-end).

3. `SQL` is utilized for querying user data during login processes and within member functions.

4. `PHP` and `HTML` are used for designing the front-end interface.

5. `Tomcat` is deployed for deploying and managing our web applications.
